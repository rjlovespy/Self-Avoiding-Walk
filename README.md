2. It also discusses the mean displacement of a drunkard taking SAW of 500 steps in 2D with unequal step length in the four directions namely East, West, North, South via considering its microcanonical ensemble. Further it addresses its convergent nature.
3. It also discusses the effect of step size on the displacement of a drunkard taking SAW of 50 steps.
4. Lastly, it dicusses the effect of non-uniform probability over the four directions on the displacement of a drunkard taking SAW of 200 steps.
