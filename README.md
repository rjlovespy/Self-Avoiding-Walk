1. It discusses the mean displacement of a drunkard taking SAW of 500 steps in 2D with equal step length in the four directions namely East, West, North, South via considering its microcanonical ensemble. Further it addresses its neither convergent nor divergent nature.
2. It also discusses the mean displacement of a drunkard taking SAW of 500 steps in 2D with unequal step length in the four directions namely East, West, North, South via considering its microcanonical ensemble. Further it addresses its convergent nature.
3. It also discusses the effect of step size on the displacement of a drunkard taking SAW of 50 steps.
4. Lastly, it dicusses the effect of non-uniform probability over the four directions on the displacement of a drunkard taking SAW of 200 steps.

@ Note:-
The algorithm which is used here to generate a SAW works such that no previously visited x-coordinate and y-coordinate can be retraced more than once which poses more restrictions than required. However to define a true SAW, one just needs to consider the fact that for an already visited lattice point, the index of the previously visited x-coordinate and y-coordinate must be the same.
